            How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
            security attacks? </p>
        <p id="web-security-answer">
            Cybersecurity is very complex and requires a well-organized approach. 
            <br> 
            The most efficient IT security processes are based on automation and integration. 
            <br>
            Integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) saves a lot of time and makes remediation much easier. 
            <br>
            The devTeam must be educated and updated about potential security problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            The key tool for web application security is the vulnerability scanner. 
            Even the best vulnerability scanner will not be able to discover all vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.
            <br>
            To fully secure web servers, vulnerability scanning must be combined with network scanning. 
            <br>
            Businesses should use diverse security measures, but you should not just believe that purchasing them and giving them to your security team will solve the problem. 
            <br>
            To fully and continuously evaluate your security stance, the best way is to perform continuous security exercises such as red team vs blue team campaigns or establishing a bounty program.</p>
